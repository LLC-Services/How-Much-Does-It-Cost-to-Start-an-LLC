Starting a Limited Liability Company (LLC) is a popular choice for structuring a business in the U.S. due to its flexibility and liability protection.

While the process is straightforward, LLC filing fees vary significantly by state.

Whether you’re a freelancer, small business owner, or startup founder, understanding these costs is essential for budgeting and decision-making.

This guide provides a comprehensive state-by-state breakdown of LLC formation costs, including initial filing fees, annual maintenance fees, and hidden expenses entrepreneurs often overlook.

## Why LLC Costs Matter?

When choosing a state to form your LLC, cost is a critical factor. However, it’s not just about the initial filing fee. Consider these ongoing expenses:

- **Annual or biennial report fees**: Required in most states to keep your LLC in good standing.
- **Franchise taxes**: Fees based on your business’s existence, not profits.
- **Registered agent fees**: Necessary if you form an LLC in a state where you don’t reside.
- **Business license fees**: Some states or cities require additional permits.
- **Foreign LLC registration**: Needed if you operate in multiple states, adding complexity and costs.

These expenses can significantly impact your budget, so understanding the full cost of forming and maintaining an LLC is crucial.

## Should You Form an LLC in a Different State?

Forming an LLC in a low-cost or tax-friendly state like Wyoming or Delaware may seem appealing, but weigh the pros and cons:

- **Tax Implications**: Your home state may still tax your LLC if you reside there, even if it’s registered elsewhere.

**Pro Tip**: Consult a tax professional or attorney to ensure compliance across state lines.

| **State** | **Why Choose It** |
